/* JavaScript is a dynamically typed language,
 which means that data types of variables are determined by the value 
 they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as 
 we assign different values to them.
 */

/* what is the difference between var and let 
Variables declared by let are only available inside the block 
where they're defined. Variables declared by var are available throughout the function 
in which they're declared.

/*
what is the difference between ==  and === .
== : it compares only value not datatype
===: it compares value as well as datatype

// primitive datatype : all primitive datatype are call by value.

// types : string ,number , boolean , null , undefined , symbol , BigInt

// reference type (non-primitive) - memory can be allocated directly into the computer

// array, objects , functions
