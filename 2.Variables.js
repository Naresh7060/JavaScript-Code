// Variables is the name of the memory location. where we store our data/values .

// there are three type of variables var,let,const in the javascript.

// we will use only let. we will avoid var for batter practice.

let salary = 5000; //let are available inside the block where they are defined.
console.warn('Here is your salary:  '+ salary);

var a = 22; // var are available through out the function in which they are defined
var name = "Naresh";
console.table([a,name]);


const id = 22; // once we assign the value to the const we can not change the value again.
console.log(id);
// id = 23;  //it will through an error because can not assign the value againn to the const variable.
console.log(id);

college = 'GLA university mathura';  // we can also create a variable without instilize any variable.
console.log(college);     //  but this is not good practice.
